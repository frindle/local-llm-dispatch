# PostToolUse hook on Edit|Write. Fires when Claude edits a real code file
# directly, to prompt a check: should this have gone to qwen first?
#
# WHY: standing project rule (memory feedback_dispatch_coding_to_goose,
# "UFN lets have qwen do everything we can have it do") kept getting
# overridden by Claude's own in-the-moment confidence -- caught doing this
# directly at least twice in one session (a ttyd/Cloudflare plist setup, then
# a Rivian session-length constant) despite the standing rule, each time only
# because the owner asked "would you have dispatched that if I didn't remind you?"
# A memory-based rule only works if Claude remembers to apply it; a hook fires
# regardless. This is a NUDGE, not a block -- plenty of edits are legitimately
# exempt (physical/hardware steps, applying an already-reviewed qwen-produced
# fix, genuine one-liners, orchestration/dispatch-mechanism code itself where
# the bootstrapping is awkward) and Claude's own judgment still decides.
