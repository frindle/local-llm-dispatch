# TOP of the session so it gets folded into planning, not deferred to Stop.
# The owner 2026-09-09: "we need to ensure you remember" — front-loading the nudge is
# the forcing function (the handoff-passdown SessionStart inject is what actually
# gets acted on). Read-only: handoff-emit.py --json writes nothing.
# Fires whenever there is ANY actionable backlog (real dispatches always count;
# eval cr: arms only past a threshold so a routine bench run doesn't nag).

# DIAGNOSIS-ONLY HEADLESS SESSION -> self-skip.
# THE BUG THIS FIXES (2026-09-24): dispatch-escalation-watcher.py spawns its
# integration/escalation reviews as a headless `claude -p` from launchd, read-only
# --allowedTools, nobody at the keyboard. This hook fired there too and told that
# agent to "process the handoff panel EARLY ... then clear the processed with
# handoff-emit.py --acted", which it can neither approve nor execute. At least 2 of
# the ~18 integration reviews that night came back "I could not process the handoff
# panel this session" INSTEAD of the diagnosis they were spawned to produce -- a whole
# review round trip lost to a nudge aimed at a human.
# Any hook that asks for an interactive action self-skips when this marker is set.
