# PreToolUse (Bash|Grep|Glob) HARD GATE: block hand-troubleshooting of app source.
#
# The owner's rule (2026-09-08): qwen should do the troubleshooting, not Claude, unless
# The owner explicitly says to do it manually. Advisory reminders don't reliably fire
# (proven this session), so this BLOCKS the reflex at its start: investigation-
# shaped Bash (recursive greps / source-file reads) into an app repo's source is
# denied unless a dispatch is clearly the vehicle or the owner has authorised manual.
#
# Extended (2026-09-17): the Grep and Glob TOOLS are also gated. Those tools ARE
# a recursive search -- there is no "investigation shape" sub-test for them: a
# Grep/Glob whose target is non-exempt app source is inherently a spelunk and is
# denied. Single targeted Read-tool reads stay allowed (Read is NOT gated).
#
# It gates the READ phase specifically -- writing the dispatch spec still needs to
# know entry points, so single targeted reads are allowed; it's the spelunk
# (grep -r/rg across app source, chained cat/sed/head/tail of source files) that
# is blocked.
#
# NOT blocked (pass through):
#   - anything when the manual token ~/.claude/.qwen-manual exists
#   - paths under a dispatch worktree (~/dispatch-worktrees, ~/.ollama-dispatch,
#     .claude/worktrees) or harness paths (~/bin, ~/.claude, machine-config) --
#     that IS dispatch / mechanism work, which is exempt
#   - curl/API data pulls, git, ls, queue status, and other non-investigation cmds
#   - a single-file read (one sed/cat/head/tail target) -- spec research is allowed
#
# Bypass: `touch ~/.claude/.qwen-manual` (I do this only when the owner says "manual"),
# and `rm` it when the manual task is done.
