# PreToolUse (Write|Edit|NotebookEdit) HARD GATE: block hand-authoring of app
# source code. The authoring analog of dispatch-troubleshoot-gate.sh.
#
# The owner's rule (feedback_dispatch_coding_to_goose): qwen writes coding work by
# default, not Claude, UNLESS the edit is genuinely exempt (a physical/hardware
# step, applying an already-reviewed qwen fix, a true one-liner, or the dispatch
# mechanism itself). The prior guards were both too weak to stop the reflex:
#   - dispatch-handauthor-guard.sh only fired on files ending verify.test.ts, and
#     was non-blocking.
#   - dispatch-to-qwen-reminder.sh is PostToolUse -- it fires AFTER the code is
#     already written, so it can only nag, never prevent (2026-09-17: it "fired"
#     on a 400-line build.py that had already been hand-authored).
# A post-hoc nag cannot prevent the action. This BLOCKS the write itself.
#
# BLOCKS: a Write/Edit/NotebookEdit whose target is a CODE file inside a
#   non-exempt app repo (GitHub Projects/<repo>, or a src/lib/app/components/pages
#   dir). Deny -> the reflex is redirected to the dispatch pipeline.
#
# NOT blocked (pass through):
#   - fresh manual token ~/.claude/.qwen-manual (<6h; self-expires like the
#     troubleshoot gate's -- a stale token silently disables the gate otherwise)
#   - harness / mechanism paths (~/bin, ~/.claude, machine-config, dispatch
#     worktrees, .ollama-dispatch, bakeoff, scratchpad) -- that IS dispatch work
#   - non-code files: docs (.md/.txt), data/config (.json/.yaml/.toml/.csv),
#     markup/style (.html/.css/.svg/.xml) -- editing these is not "coding work"
#   - anything outside an app repo's source (a stray path with no repo/src signal)
#
# Bypass for a genuine exemption (reviewed qwen fix, one-liner, physical step):
#   touch ~/.claude/.qwen-manual   # self-expires in 6h; rm it when done.
