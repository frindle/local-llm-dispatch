# Review: src/fetchState.ts

## VERDICT: PASS
_nothing survived verification._

**No defects found.**

1 candidate finding(s) were raised during review and every one was rejected by the verification pass as not a real defect. On a clean change this is the expected result.

## Rejected by verification

Raised during review, then knocked down when checked against the code by a pass that did not write them. Listed for audit, not for action.

- ~~The change replaces a hardcoded `true` with the result of `readHealth()`, but `readHealth()` is an async function that returns a Promise, not a boolean value.~~ — harness override: the verifier's own probe showed identical results for old and new code at every value it tested. The diff shows `readHealth()` being called with `await`, which correctly resolves the Promise to its actu

## How this was produced

- Model `qwen3.6-35b-a3b-vl-mtp-mxfp8`, num_ctx 65,536, think=off — 2 calls, 6s of model time
- Wall clock 6s
- Filtered before you saw them: 0 finding(s) quoting code that is not in the diff, 0 with no concrete failure scenario, 1 rejected by verification

*Every quote above was checked as a literal substring of the real input before the finding was allowed to appear, and every finding had to supply a concrete failure scenario and survive an adversarial re-check.*
