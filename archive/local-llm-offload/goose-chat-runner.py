"""Queue RUNNER that serves ONE Goose (or any OpenAI-client) chat completion.

WHY THIS EXISTS (Penn 2026-10-01: "goose needs to run through queue for everything,
even chat"): standing policy is that ALL GPU/inference work goes through
~/bin/ollama-queue.py, so the single studio-db lane (local Darkbloom, cap shared with
fleet traffic) is honestly accounted for and visible on the dashboard. Until now Goose
talked to Darkbloom's OpenAI endpoint DIRECTLY, taking a slot invisibly. Now
~/bin/goose-queue-proxy.py enqueues one queue job per chat request and this runner is
the thing the queue launches on the lane.

CONTRACT WITH THE QUEUE (ALLOWED_RUNNERS, ollama-queue.py): the queue passes exactly
--model --host --num-ctx --cwd --task-file and nothing else; the runner owns everything
else and its own output. `--task-file` is the VERBATIM OpenAI request body (JSON) the
client sent; `--cwd` is the per-request job directory the proxy created, and is where
this runner writes its output files:

    request.json   (= --task-file; the proxy writes it)
    stream.sse     SSE bytes, appended + flushed as they arrive upstream (stream:true)
    response.json  the upstream JSON response (stream:false)
    error.json     an OpenAI-shaped error object, on any failure
    done.json      TERMINAL marker, written LAST: {"ok": bool, "stream": bool, ...}

The proxy tails stream.sse and relays it to the client; `done.json` is what tells it the
job is over. Nothing here is a code dispatch: the job is enqueued --task-kind research
with a --runner, which ollama-queue.py's `ungateable()` already treats as having no diff
to gate, so no gate/regate row is ever created for a chat turn.

DIFFERENCE FROM ~/bin/darkbloom_chat.py: that module is the non-streaming,
JSON-schema-oriented single-shot path the review/research runners use -- it builds its
own body (system+user messages, response_format ladder, enable_thinking=false) and
strips <think> blocks. A chat proxy must do the OPPOSITE: forward the client's body
MOSTLY VERBATIM, including `tools`, `tool_choice`, `stream: true`, `temperature`,
`response_format` and whatever else Goose sends, because the client -- not us -- owns the
protocol. So only its AUTH/ALIAS/TRANSIENT-RETRY facts are reused (imported, not copied):

  * the Bearer key lives in ~/.darkbloom/local.json and ROTATES on every Darkbloom
    restart, so it is re-read per request (and per retry) and NEVER logged, printed or
    put in argv;
  * the base URL comes from the same record (darkbloom_chat.base_url());
  * 429/500/502/503/504 are transient (shared slots at the cap, a provider restart) and
    are re-sent after a short backoff -- but ONLY while nothing has been relayed yet: a
    retry after the client has already seen tokens would duplicate the response.
