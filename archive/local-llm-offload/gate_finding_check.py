"""gate_finding_check.py -- make a gate reviewer's finding FALSIFIABLE.

WHY (unattended-readiness item 4, Penn/Main 2026-10-04)
-------------------------------------------------------
The authoritative re-gate reviewer (studio-27b-regate) flags correct code, and on a
GREEN verify that parks the slice as needs_opus. Main overrode every one by hand:
chat-fixes s4b (a0be91760fb5, a330fff2d326 -- "build_request mutates the input
list"; it builds new dicts), s6c (ef2868d21945 -- "'queued' silently dropped"), and
the "concerns / PASS WITH CAVEATS" parks whose only finding is the reviewer's own
UNCERTAIN caveat (c63772e0b710, b1b085738769).

A reviewer finding is a CLAIM about behaviour. This module turns it into a check:
  1. a second model call (runner side, `runner_main`) is asked for a REPRODUCER --
     a `def reproduce():` that drives the real code with the claim's trigger and
     asserts the CORRECT behaviour. The model only PROPOSES; it never decides.
  2. the GATE executes it (`check_row`) in a THROWAWAY COPY of the exact tree the
     reviewer saw (launch-baseline archive + the gated diff), and again on the
     baseline tree, and classifies the outcome DETERMINISTICALLY:
       head fails (assert / exception raised from the code under test), baseline
         does not fail the same way          -> CONFIRMED  (parks, reproducer attached)
       head fails, baseline fails identically -> pre-existing (advisory: this change
                                               did not introduce it)
       head passes                           -> UNCONFIRMED (advisory caveat; lands)
       no usable reproducer                  -> UNCONFIRMED (advisory caveat; lands)
       timeout / harness / env error         -> ERROR (fail-safe: park exactly as today)

PURE parts (`plan`, `classify_row`, `overall`, `apply_outcome`, prompt build/parse)
are what --self-test and the unit tests drive; `materialize`/`run_reproducer` are
the only side-effecting pieces and are bounded (size cap, timeout, scratch HOME).

LANGUAGES (2026-10-14, cardBonuses-v2 964c4a833b82): Python AND TypeScript/JavaScript. A TS finding used
to be "cannot be reproduced mechanically" -> parked as needs_opus even when it was false (the 27b regate
reviewer claimed `1e15 / 1` under-counts; `1e15 / 1 === 1e15` in IEEE 754 and the cited trigger returns the
right answer). A JS reproducer is an ES module (`export function reproduce()`, node:assert) run by
`node --experimental-strip-types` against the same throwaway trees; "touched the cited file" is read from
V8 coverage (a non-top-level function of the cited file ran), the analogue of the Python settrace check.

LIMITS (stated, not hidden): the verifier can only CONFIRM what a reproducer shows.
A real defect whose reproducer is vacuous (asserts too little) or cannot be written
(timing races, UI, non-Python code) comes back UNCONFIRMED and LANDS as an advisory
caveat -- that is the false-negative risk this design accepts in exchange for not
parking correct code. It is bounded by: a green verify, a relevance-PROVEN fixture
(plan() refuses otherwise), the baseline differential, and the caveat being recorded.

Write a Python module that defines `def reproduce():` (no arguments). Rules:
1. The working directory and sys.path[0] are the repository root. Import the module
   under test by its module path (e.g. `import dashboard_chat`, `from pkg import mod`).
2. reproduce() must call the REAL code the claim is about, with the input/trigger the
   claim describes, and then `assert` the CORRECT behaviour -- what the code does if
   the claim is FALSE. If the claim is TRUE, reproduce() must fail: your assert fails,
   or the code under test raises.
3. Never catch exceptions raised by the code under test. Never assert that the claim
   is wrong in prose; never print a verdict.
4. Isolation: create any files under tempfile.mkdtemp(); point environment variables
   the code reads at temp paths; never touch the network, the real home directory,
   or real services. Patch subprocess, sockets, HTTP, threads and time.sleep with
   unittest.mock when the code would invoke them, and assert on the mock's calls if
