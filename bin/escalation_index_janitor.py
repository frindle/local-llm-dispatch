"""escalation_index_janitor -- tick ESCALATIONS.md / READY-TO-LAND.md rows whose
underlying item is RESOLVED, from the pipeline's own state, never from prose.

WHY (2026-10-05): 40 rows were open at once and every one of them was already
resolved somewhere else -- the slice was accepted (`done`), the chain landed, the
plan was produced by a later plan-gen round, the needs_opus job was resolved, the
bundle was no longer parked. Nothing ever ticked a row, so the SessionStart hook
reported 40 "stuck" items and a human had to re-derive each one by hand. That is
exactly the opposite of unattended: a worklist that only grows gets ignored.

WHAT CLOSES A ROW (each needs POSITIVE evidence read from a state file; an
unreadable or missing source closes NOTHING):
  slice rows (A/B)        the slice is `done`/`skipped`, or its plan is
                          human-cancelled (plan_cancel), or it was re-sliced into
                          its own live sub-plan `<plan>-<sid>`.
  job rows (C/D/F, hex id) the job's slice (from the row label) is done/skipped or
                          its plan cancelled; or the job is `done` in live queue
                          state; or it is GONE from a readable live queue state
                          (worklist rows -- failed/needs_opus/blocked -- are never
                          pruned, only `resolve`/`cancel` removes them, so absence
                          is a human/automation having handled it); or, for a
                          `plan-gen-<L>-rN` job, plan <L> now exists (a later round
                          produced it) or is cancelled.
  integration rows (E)     WHOLE-CHAIN gate: integration now `passed`/`staged`, or
                          plan cancelled. CHAIN STAGED: integration `landed` is set
                          or `passed` (incl. "already on main"), the row's stage
                          branch was superseded by a re-stage or retired (branch
                          gone), or plan cancelled. A still-`staged` row whose
                          stage git says is no longer a fast-forward of main is
                          RE-STAGED (--integrate; never writes main) and re-decided.
  BUNDLE PARKED (Q)        the bundle is no longer in the queue's `_bundle_parked`,
                          or it is a cancelled plan, or it is a `plan-gen-<L>` bundle
                          whose plan <L> now exists/is cancelled; while it IS parked,
                          only the NEWEST open row per bundle stays open (older rows
                          are superseded by it).

HOW: a same-length, in-place `[ ]` -> `[x]` byte flip at the row's offset (re-read
and re-checked under the write), so a row another process appends concurrently is
never lost (the appenders do not lock). Every close is logged as one JSON line to
ESCALATIONS-AUTOCLOSE.jsonl beside the index (row, rule, evidence).

CLI:  escalation_index_janitor.py [--apply] [--index F] [--ready F]
      (default is a DRY RUN that prints what would close).
