"""Standalone agentic coding dispatch against Ollama's native /api/chat,
bypassing opencode's CLI entirely.

Built 2026-08-21 because opencode's CLI has two confirmed harness bugs
that make it unreliable for real dispatch:
  1. It corrupts the user-turn prompt before sending it to the provider
     (partial/broken quote-escaping) -- causally proven, 0/7 vs 6/6
     tool-call success with/without the corruption. Filed upstream:
     https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues/43923
  2. A separate infinite self-nudge loop in its `build` agent
     ("Continue if you have next steps..."), confirmed model-independent.
Both bugs live inside opencode's compiled binary and don't exist if
opencode isn't in the dispatch path -- hence this script talks to Ollama
directly and implements its own minimal tool-execution loop.

Termination is based purely on "the model's response has no more
tool_calls" -- never on injecting a self-generated "continue" prompt --
which is the structural fix for bug #2 above.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a focused coding agent. You have ten tools: \
list_files, read_file, write_file, edit_file, run_bash, web_search, \
web_fetch, request_diagnostics, request_more_iterations, and task_complete. \
When you need evidence (recent commits, a diff, a grep, a file window, the \
verify output, container logs), call request_diagnostics with a list of \
requests before reaching for run_bash -- it is bounded and read-only, so it \
cannot damage the tree. Use them to \
accomplish the task directly -- don't describe what you would do, actually \
call the tools.

You are running under a finite iteration budget, and the harness keeps \
you informed of it: after each iteration's tool results it appends a \
short note of the form "[Iteration i/N: R remaining in your budget.]", \
and when few iterations remain it says so explicitly. Track your own \
progress against that budget as you go -- if you can see concrete \
remaining work that will not fit in the iterations left, call \
request_more_iterations now with a specific reason and how many more \
you need. Use exactly the standard its description sets: only for real \
remaining work you can point to -- never as a routine check-in, and \
never to recover from being stuck (fix the actual problem instead). It \
pauses the session for review rather than granting anything immediately; \
if the task is actually done, call task_complete.

ALWAYS start by calling list_files on '.' to see the project's real \
structure, then read the files that matter, BEFORE writing anything. Never \
guess a file path, and never assume a framework or directory layout -- \
discover it. The project's existing stack and conventions are whatever \
list_files and read_file actually show you, not what a project like this \
usually looks like. Prefer edit_file over write_file when changing an \
existing file.

If AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md or CONTRIBUTING.md exist at the top \
level, read them before writing any code. They are written for you and \
state this project's conventions, which may deliberately differ from what \
you learned in training. Follow them over your own habits.

Before you CREATE a new file, read an existing file of the same kind in \
this project and match its idiom exactly -- its imports, its export style, \
its function signatures, its naming. A framework often has several valid \
styles from different versions; the only one that works here is the one \
already in use. If you are adding an API route, read an existing API route \
first. If you are adding a module or target, read how existing ones are \
declared. Your training data is likely to be older than this project.

web_search/web_fetch are for external documentation only (an unfamiliar \
third-party API). Never use them to learn about the project in front of \
you -- that is what list_files and read_file are for.

If you import or require a package, make sure it is actually a dependency \
of this project first -- check package.json (or the equivalent manifest) \
with read_file, and if it is missing either install it with run_bash or \
use something already available. Code that imports a package the project \
does not have will fail to build.

If a path you tried does not exist, do not try it again. Call list_files \
to find where the file actually is, and only use paths you have seen in a \
list_files result.

When the task is fully complete, call task_complete with a short summary. \
(A plain-text response with no further tool calls also ends the session, \
but task_complete is preferred -- it lets the harness confirm your work \
against the task's verification command before accepting it, instead of \
finding out only afterward.) Keep file paths relative to the working \
directory. Do not ask clarifying questions; make reasonable assumptions \
and proceed."""

RESEARCH_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a focused research agent. You have two \
tools that matter for this task: web_search (self-hosted SearXNG) and \
web_fetch (reads the full content of a specific URL, including PDFs). You \
also have list_files/read_file/write_file/edit_file/run_bash available, but \
this is a research task, not a coding task -- there is no project to \
discover and nothing to build. Do not call list_files or read_file out of \
habit; there is nothing there to find unless the task itself gives you a \
reason to look.

A web_search result is a short snippet only -- a title, URL, and one or two \
truncated sentences. It is NEVER enough on its own to state a specific \
number, date, name, or any other concrete fact. For every specific claim in \
your final answer, you must have actually called web_fetch on a real source \
and read its content. If you catch yourself about to state a specific \
detail you only saw in a snippet, not in fetched page content, stop and \
fetch the source first, or say plainly in your final answer that you \
couldn't confirm it. A wrong-but-confident answer is worse than an honest \
"I couldn't verify this."

Use web_search multiple times with different, more specific queries if your \
first search doesn't turn up enough -- don't stop after one search just \
because it returned something.

When you have enough to answer the question, respond with your final answer \
as plain text and no further tool calls -- do not write it to a file unless \
the task explicitly asked for a file. Do not ask clarifying questions; make \
reasonable judgment calls about scope and proceed."""

# Added 2026-08-28 after confirming live (qwen3.5:9b) that reusing the
# coding SYSTEM_PROMPT for a research dispatch actively causes harm, not
# just irrelevance: "You are a focused coding agent... ALWAYS start by
# calling list_files on '.'" primed the model, on an EMPTY research scratch
# directory, to hallucinate an entire unrelated coding task (it wrote a
# Flask web server nobody asked for) rather than doing the research the
# task actually described. The whole rest of that prompt (matching existing
# code idiom, reading AGENTS.md/package.json, "Prefer edit_file over
# write_file") is equally irrelevant noise for a task with no project to
# read. This is a separate, more foundational fix than the corrective-nudge
# task_kind fix above -- that one only affects behavior once a no-tool-call
# response happens; this one shapes the model's understanding of what kind
# of task it's even doing from the very first token.

    (the Unraid model-survey task) burned its entire iteration budget hitting
    empty results and never converging -- confirmed live, independent of any
    model, that SearXNG's every enabled general-web engine (brave, duckduckgo,
    google cse, startpage) was simultaneously suspended ("too many requests" /
    CAPTCHA), a known SearXNG operational issue (self-hosted instances get
    bot-detected), not a query problem. Retested ~15-20 min later and it had
    self-cleared with no config change -- so a bounded retry-with-backoff here
    covers the common case (a suspension already near expiry).

    2026-08-28: the retry-with-backoff above was originally paired with a
    claim that the real fix needed a settings.yml change + container restart
    on Unraid (unreachable, no SSH/Docker access) -- that claim was wrong, not
    verified. Checked live via /config: this instance actually has far more
    general-web engines ENABLED than were ever being queried (bing, mojeek,
    qwant, "duckduckgo web" as a distinct engine from plain duckduckgo, yahoo,
    etc, on top of the 4 default ones) -- they just weren't part of the
    *default* engine set a plain /search call (no `engines=` param) hits.
    Confirmed live which of them actually return real results right now
    (`bing` and `duckduckgo web` both did; `qwant` CAPTCHA'd, `yahoo` errored
    -- same class of failure as the original 4, so not worth adding). Now
    passing an explicit `engines=` param naming both the original 4 AND the
    2 newly-confirmed ones, so a simultaneous suspension needs 6 independent
    engines down at once instead of 4 -- a client-side fix, no Unraid access
    needed at all. `mojeek` was tried too and returned zero results for the
    test query without being flagged unresponsive -- inconclusive rather than
    confirmed-working, left out until it's verified on a query with known
    real results.
    When it's STILL empty after retrying, tell the model WHY (which engines are
    down and why) instead of a flat "No results found" -- so it can correctly
    treat that as an infra gap to note, not as proof the thing it searched for
    doesn't exist (the failure mode that burned the whole iteration budget).

    Renamed 2026-08-30 from tool_web_search to _search_searxng: now the SearXNG fallback behind the

    detect PDF content (both by Content-Type header AND by magic bytes,

    WHY (bg-crypto s3, 2026-09-19): this was unconditionally
    `resumed_at_iteration + max_iters`, so EVERY resume bought a full fresh

    per-resume allowance, not a bound on the job. Job c71f0581d998 was
    externally SIGTERM'd and resumed six times and its ceiling walked
    14 -> 21 -> 24 -> 26 -> 27, running 09:24 to 15:29 -- about six hours -- on
    a nominal 14-iteration budget that never once bound it.

    That compounds badly with the daemon's kickstart-orphans bug: every
    involuntary SIGTERM produces a resume, and every resume silently bought
    another full budget, so the more the queue churned the less max_iters meant.

    A deliberate grant still extends -- that is the documented review-gate flow
    (`request_more_iterations` pauses, a human resumes with more budget), and
    `context_threshold` likewise resumes with a raised ceiling. An involuntary
    pause restores the ORIGINAL ceiling instead: the work resumes where it left
    off, with the budget it always had.

    so two runs can be diffed to isolate the failures a model's diff actually INTRODUCED
    from failures already present at dispatch start (the baseline).

    Added 2026-08-30 after a real convergence failure (resell-tracker): a --verify of
    `npx tsc --noEmit && npm test` returned 168 errors on the UNEDITED worktree -- a
    missing `prisma generate` left every DB result typed `any`. The dispatched model made
    its two CORRECT edits, which left all 168 pre-existing errors in place, and the harness
    fed the whole 168-line dump back as 'fix the reported problems': undirectable noise in
    files the model never opened. It correctly refused to touch them and looped
    task_complete to the cap, then reported FAILED. Diffing current-vs-baseline turns that
    into 'you introduced 0 new failures', which is directable (accept) instead of noise.

    Normalization keeps only DIAGNOSTIC-looking lines (individual compiler errors and
    test-failure markers, per _VERIFY_DIAG_RES) and drops aggregate/summary/timing lines.
    Rationale for that specific asymmetry: a single diagnostic is deterministic and
    location-anchored, so set-difference isolates exactly the diagnostics attributable to
    the diff; aggregate lines are per-RUN not per-defect and drift with counts (168 vs
    165), so including them would flag a pure REDUCTION in errors as a spurious 'new' line.
    A line matching no known diagnostic shape is DROPPED rather than guessed at -- the
    failure modes are not symmetric: a false 'no new failures' is still caught downstream
    by the end-of-run authoritative verify (which continues to fail on real regressions

    An auto-author / auto-refine dispatch's deliverable is a STATE -- "the harness
    discriminates and is satisfiable" -- not a diff. When the harness is already
    complete (a resumed authoring run, or a refine round enqueued for a reason
    that turned out not to exist), the correct model behaviour is to change
    NOTHING. The unchanged-tree vacuous-pass guard then failed it for doing the
    right thing: measured, 13 jobs have been failed by that guard and 10 of them
    (77%) were exactly this. A FAILED authoring slice is re-author-eligible, so
    each one seeds the retry storm MAX_AUTHOR_ATTEMPTS exists to cap.

    Deliberately keyed on the VERIFY'S OWN OUTPUT -- not the job label, not
    task_kind. Only the authoring self-check emits this marker, so a coding
    dispatch can never claim the exemption and a genuine zero-edit vacuous pass on
    real code is still caught exactly as before. That is the case this must not
    loosen, and it is what the revert-test pins.

    HARDENED 2026-09-19 after independent review. The first cut tested
    `MARKER in stdout + stderr` -- an UNANCHORED SUBSTRING of a string that is not
    secret and that ships inside every worktree: write_harness_check() writes
    auto-harness-check.py, containing this exact literal, into the same tree where
    a coding slice's verify.sh later runs. So any verify output that merely
    SURFACED that file's text -- a repo-wide grep, a lint or traceback quoting the
    line, a stray cat -- claimed the anti-fraud exemption for a genuinely vacuous
    coding pass. Two independent conditions now, both required:

      1. the marker is a WHOLE LINE of the output, not a substring of one, so
         quoting it inside a larger line (grep hits, tracebacks) no longer counts;
      2. the verify COMMAND is the harness check itself.

    (2) is the load-bearing one, and note what it keys on: WHICH INSTRUMENT RAN.
    That is not the rejected "trust the job label / task_kind" -- the label is a
    claim about the job, while the verify command is the thing actually executed to
    produce this output. A coding slice's verify is its own verify.sh and can never
    be auto-harness-check.py, so a coding dispatch cannot reach the exemption even
    if it reproduces the marker byte-for-byte on its own line.

# asking what the run had left in the tree. Live case:
# auto-refine-bo-O-qwen36-35b-a3b-studio-s1-fastapi-existing-route-p-r1 (job
# 765661efeb0c). A harness-refine round whose real deliverable is the fixture
# applied refimpl.py to the TARGET to prove the fixture discriminates -- which is
# legitimate and is how these rounds validate themselves -- but applied it via its
# own run_bash iterations rather than through auto-harness-check.py, whose
# try/finally revert() is the thing that normally puts the target back. The verify
# then emitted the self-check marker, this branch logged "zero-diff ACCEPTED", and
# the job completed with the TARGET holding refimpl's reference solution verbatim
# and uncommitted. The next stage's pre-flight baseline-clean gate saw `M <target>`,
# NO-GO'd and escalated the slice -- a second-order failure that reads as an
# unrelated "queue stuck" incident until it is traced back to here. This is the
# "dirty launch-baseline cascade" auto-harness-check.py's own finally-block
# comment names; that block only covers the path where the check itself applied
# the refimpl.
#
# SCOPE IS THE WHOLE DESIGN HERE, and it is deliberately NOT "restore the working
# tree to its start state". A whole-tree `git checkout -- .` at this point is the
# bg-captcha-s3-vision bug (see auto-harness-check.py's pre_tracked snapshot and
# ollama-dispatch-auto's baseline-clean blocker rewrite): once the slicer chain's
# clean_and_seal() has committed the harness into the baseline, the refine model's
# fixture / TASK.md / refimpl.py edits are TRACKED and uncommitted, so a blanket
# checkout silently destroys the round's actual deliverable while still exiting 0 --
# the model then finds its work gone with no error to explain it. The pipeline's
# own contract is "only <target>/<fixture>/refimpl.py/TASK.md may change", so this
# touches exactly ONE file, the declared target from .dispatch-harness.json, and
# never the harness files that ARE the exempt branch's stated deliverable.
#

# not revert": destroying state we cannot prove was ours is strictly worse than
# leaving residue for the next pre-flight to catch loudly.

    WHY THIS AXIS. The two existing guards are both REPETITION-keyed: the read-side
    early abort needs anti-thrash cache-serves plus a tree unchanged since dispatch
    START, and write_thrash_abort needs the same (path, content) 3x. A run that
    writes genuinely DIFFERENT bytes every iteration mints a fresh key each time and
    arms neither, which is how bg-crypto's s3 ground to a force-stop. This measures
    forward motion instead of self-similarity, so write/revert oscillation and
    churn-that-nets-to-nothing both show up.

    WHY IT DOES NOT ACT (coordinator sign-off 2026-09-19). The motivating case is
    already fixed and no longer reproducible: bg-crypto's loops (c71f0581d998,

    that reads and analyses for several iterations before writing has a legitimately
    unchanged tree, and that is exactly what a careful run looks like early on. So
    this gathers the real distribution first; a threshold, if one is ever wanted,
    gets chosen from data instead of guessed.

    `snapshot is None` (cwd not a git work tree) records NOTHING rather than
    counting a stall -- absence of measurement is not evidence of stalling, the same

# the resume transcript 20260919T160454Z.json:
#
#   [20] think=eb4d1d9965 len=2297  read_file lib/bfmrWeb.ts + ls lib | grep -i join
#   [23] think=049238f41c len=2296  read_file lib/bfmrSplitSibling.test.ts

#   [30][33][35][38][42][45] all eb4d1d9965, all read_file lib/bfmrVerify.test.ts
#
# [20] and [25] are byte-identical; [23] differs from [20] by ONE character ("core
# issue now -- when" vs "core issue now: when"). So the model's reasoning was a
# fixed point from [20] onward -- roughly SIX iterations before the first repeated
# tool signature at [30], which is the earliest moment the signature-keyed
# loop-detect/anti-thrash above can possibly notice anything. [20]->[28] are four
# DIFFERENT tool signatures derived from one frozen reasoning state, so the existing
# detectors are structurally blind to them.
#
# This detector watches the signal that actually went stale: `message["thinking"]`,
# which the worker already captures (see _save_transcript / the streaming reader) and
# until now never used for anything but display. Two consecutive near-identical
# reasoning blocks is not a style quirk, it is a decode fixed point -- the model is
# re-deriving the same next action forever and no amount of appended prose will move
# it (see the harvest helpers below for why the run is not simply discarded).
#
# Deliberately conservative, so this can never pathologise a working run:
#   * blocks shorter than REASONING_FREEZE_MIN_CHARS are ignored and RESET the streak
#     -- a terse "Let me check the tests." repeated twice is not a fixed point, and
#     models run with --think off emit no thinking at all and are unaffected entirely.
#   * comparison is on a punctuation/whitespace/case-normalised form at
#     REASONING_FREEZE_SIMILARITY, so the one-character [20]->[23] drift above counts
#     as a repeat instead of resetting the counter (that single char is exactly how
#     this failure evaded a naive exact-hash check).
#   * the FIRST repeat only nudges (same idiom as loop-detect's 3x); the hard stop
#     needs REASONING_FREEZE_AFTER consecutive repeats. On the BFMR transcript that
#     nudges at [23] and stops at [25] -- ~5 iterations before the real abort at 18/31.

# with ZERO content and ZERO tool calls. The live logs show every one was thinking the
# whole way: num_predict (DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS) is ONE budget shared by qwen3.8's
# `thinking` and its answer, so a hard reasoning step (cb21d: per-mutant analysis of a
# relevance report -- coherent, not a loop) used all of it and never emitted the action.
# The worker then (a) stripped that thinking from the replayed transcript, (b) treated
# the turn as a model that CHOSE to answer blank -- the generic one-shot "your last
# response was empty" nudge -- so the next turn re-derived the lost ~10 min of
# reasoning from scratch, and (c) had no nudge left for a second truncation, which
# would then be accepted as a blank final answer.
# Fix: recognise the truncation (done_reason == "length", or completion == the cap,
# with nothing emitted) as a BUDGET event, not a model choice: hand the tail of the
# lost reasoning back so it is not re-derived, tell the model to act now, and give

# every assistant turn's `content` was the empty string (the model spoke only through
# tool calls), so _extract_final_answer in ollama-queue.py found no assistant text and
# the job wrote no <id>.answer.md. Yet the frozen `thinking` block it died holding was
# a real, substantially-correct partial diagnosis -- split rows share reserved_at /
# item / order_id so the join key collides, the upsert key is userId_lineKey, and the
# open question is whether BFMR's web surface returns two rows or one collapsed qty=8
# row. That was thrown away and the whole dispatch re-run from scratch.
#
# A thrash abort is a stop, not a reason to discard what the run already worked out.
# So on a non-converged THRASH/FREEZE abort that left no assistant text at all, recover
# the last substantive reasoning block and append it as a clearly-labelled assistant
# message. That single append makes the whole existing pipeline carry it:
# ollama-queue.py's _extract_final_answer walks the transcript for the last assistant
# turn with non-empty content, so the job gets its durable <id>.answer.md and its
# ANSWER.md for free, with no queue-side change at all.

# scratchpad -- mid-thought, frequently self-contradictory, and by construction from a
# run that FAILED. It must never be readable as a finished answer. The run stays
