# Launch the Unraid-hosted Goose chat front end.
#
# The owner 2026-10-01 (supersedes the chat-through-the-queue build; see
# goose-darkbloom.sh.bak-unraidchat):
#   CHAT  -> Unraid Ollama, hard-bound, model kept warm, num_ctx pinned to the pregate's
#            confirmed-safe value. Never queues behind Studio work.
#   WORK  -> still 100% through ~/bin/ollama-queue.py, dispatched FROM the chat by the
#            `queue_dispatch` tool in ~/bin/goose-queue-mcp.py. Every investigation /
#            code change / research task is still a studio-db dashboard row.
#
#   goose -> ~/bin/goose-queue-proxy.py (127.0.0.1:8011) -> http://192.0.2.82:11434/api/chat
#         \-> ~/bin/goose-queue-mcp.py (stdio MCP) -> ollama-queue.py enqueue -> studio-db
#
# The name is kept for muscle memory and so nothing that calls it breaks. This script
# still reads NO Darkbloom API key -- the key rotates on every Darkbloom restart and
# nothing in the chat path needs it now that chat does not touch Darkbloom at all.
# ~/.darkbloom/local.json is untouched; the queue's own runners still use it.
#
# Only ENV is overridden here; ~/.config/goose/config.yaml holds the trimmed extension
# set (goose reads env before the config file, so OPENAI_HOST here wins).
