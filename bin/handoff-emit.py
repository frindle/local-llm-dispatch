"""Ollama job handoff: what's in flight, and what's finished but not acted on.

The owner's model is WORKFLOW STATE, not gate verdict:

    pending/   jobs still in flight (queued or running)
    complete/  jobs the MODEL finished that WE have not acted on yet --
               reviewed and merged/integrated/deployed
    acted on   removed from complete/, permanently

The distinction that matters, and the thing the first version got wrong: a job
whose GATE PASSED is not "handled". resell-bfmr-oneclick gates clean and is
still unmerged -- finished by the model, untouched by us. So "acted on" is
ORTHOGONAL to the gate verdict, and only an explicit mark removes a job from
complete/. The gate columns stay, because they are how you decide what to act
on next; they just don't decide it for you.

ONE PIECE OF REAL STATE, DELIBERATELY. Everything else here is derived and the
folder can be deleted and rebuilt with --all. "Acted on" cannot be derived --
no upstream system records whether a human integrated a diff -- so it lives in
acted.json. That is not a second source of truth about job state; it is the
only source of a different fact.

A PLAIN `rm` STICKS. Deleting a page from complete/ is the obvious gesture and
it must not be undone by the next rebuild, so a rebuild treats "this job was in
the manifest and its file is now gone" as an acted-on mark and records it. The
manifest is what makes that safe: with no manifest (fresh folder, first run)
absence means "never written", not "deleted", so nothing is silently marked.

Usage:
  handoff-emit.py --all              # rebuild everything
  handoff-emit.py --job-id <id>      # refresh one job + the index (hook path)
  handoff-emit.py --acted <id> [...] # mark acted on -> drops out of complete/
  handoff-emit.py --unact <id> [...] # undo that
