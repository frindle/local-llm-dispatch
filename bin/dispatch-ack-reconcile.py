"""Reconcile the ollama handoff "awaiting action" bucket WITHOUT relying on
commit-message discipline.

WHY: dispatch-ack-hook.sh (post-commit) only acks a job whose 12-hex id appears
in the commit message. Two failure modes left jobs stuck in awaiting-action:
  * a merged fix whose hand-written commit message omitted the id, and/or a
    fast-forward merge that creates no commit on the default branch at all; and
  * a read-only diagnosis/research job, which never produces a diff and so can
    NEVER trigger a commit-keyed hook.
This reconciler closes both by looking at STATE (cwd, task_kind) instead of the
message. Two rules, both SAFE -- they only ACK (clear a job from
awaiting-action); they never touch repo content and always exit 0:

  1. CODING job whose dispatch-worktree branch is now merged into its repo's
     default branch (`git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD <origin/HEAD>`). The
     merge IS the human's acceptance (merges only happen on accepted
     dispatches), so record verdict=approve -- same contract as the post-commit
     message hook -- then --acted --merged --commit <tip>. A gate=fail job that
     was merged by an explicit human override is cleared with --override-signoff
     naming the merge as the evidence.
  2. RESEARCH job (task_kind == 'research'): read-only by design, no diff to
     merge, so clear with plain --acted (NO verdict -- it is not a code decision).

NEVER acks a coding job that is NOT merged: a 0-file coding job is a FAILED
dispatch and must stay visible. Unknown/unreadable worktree -> skip (stays for
a human). Safe no-op when nothing qualifies.

    The slicer's chain is driven only by the job-completion hook. When the hook
    fires while a driver holds the plan lock it leaves a marker for that driver to
    consume on exit -- and a driver killed by a Bash-tool timeout / closed terminal
    never exits cleanly, so the marker sits there and the plan goes silently idle
    (arr-webhook-yearly-upgrade-batches, 2026-09-23: two `slice-autofeed (advance)`
    hook fires, zero advances, until a human ran --execute 40 min later). The
    operator levers had the same hole. `ollama-dispatch-slice --sweep` is the
    periodic consumer for those stranded events; this launchd job (StartInterval
    300) is the natural place to run it. Advisory: it must never break an ack pass,
    so it is contained end to end and prints only when something was done."""
