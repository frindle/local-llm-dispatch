"""The research "Every web_fetch call in this session has failed" nudge must not fire on
a research job that verified against LOCAL files (2026-10-06).

esc-review jobs (24123dd86140, 77d808c3984a, a580c8793aa7, ~10 earlier) read the
escalation file + worktree with read_file/list_files, made zero web_fetch calls, and
were told their sources were unread; each final answer argued with the harness instead
of diagnosing. should_stamp_unverified already exempted local reads (8d690b764cec); the
nudge and the DID-NOT-CONVERGE banner did not.

Tests the REAL decision function and its wiring in ollama-worker.py (WORKER env var
points it at a backup to prove the suite goes RED there)."""
