"""Standalone regression test for the session-limit false negative.

BUG (live, 2026-09-22, job 3ca17c902224 / esim-global-s4-badge-and-merge):
headless `claude -p` answered a session-limit refusal on STDOUT -- non-empty,
exit-0-looking -- and dispatch-escalation-watcher.spawn_review only treated
EMPTY stdout as a failure. The refusal text was written out as a completed
review with "proposed fix: none written", and the job sat in needs_opus
forever because nothing knew the review had never run.

This test never needs a real rate-limited CLI: it monkeypatches
subprocess.run inside the watcher module and asserts BOTH ways --
  * a canned session-limit stdout is classified as a retryable infra failure
    (marked REVIEW BLOCKED, ledger key un-announced so the next pass retries,
    no "proposed fix: none written" footer written);
  * a canned REAL review still flows through the normal path unchanged.

Run:  python3 ~/bin/test-escalation-review-blocked.py
