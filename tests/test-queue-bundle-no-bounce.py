"""test-queue-bundle-no-bounce.py -- replay of the 2026-10-05 bundle-bounce incident.

THE INCIDENT (ollama-queue-daemon.log ~40720-40821). Bundle resell-bfmr-link-feedback
(LF) was COMMITTED. Its author round d78def02d2dd finished, and its chain driver was
"about to advance" (preflight r1). Nothing of LF was launchable for that tick, so the
idle-lane backfill let plan-gen bfe0699081c4 (bundle plan-gen-rt-bfmr-push-via-sidecar)
take studio-db. That job ran to its 12-iteration cap, and LF r1 waited behind it.
Later the regate of c228c9eb80fe wrote verdict CONCERNS and the chain ended. About 90s
later, on a timer, the queue logged "LF COMPLETE (nothing left) -- released" with no
park and no alert, then committed rt-giftcard-copy-remaining.

The owner's rule: a started bundle runs to completion. No other bundle's job takes a lane
while it is committed. A bundle stays working until its gate verdict is written. A
NON-PASS final verdict parks the bundle loudly, and that bundle resumes first once
cleared.

Everything here runs on STUBBED state: temp chain/slice/log dirs, an in-memory state
dict, and stub processes. DISPATCH_VERIFY_SANDBOX=1 and OLLAMA_QUEUE_NO_NOTIFY=1 are
set. No job is ever enqueued and no real queue state is touched.

Usage:  test-queue-bundle-no-bounce.py [--queue PATH] [--plan PATH] [--gate PATH]
Defaults are the installed ~/bin copies. The revert test passes the .bak files and
must FAIL. Exit 0 = all checks pass.
