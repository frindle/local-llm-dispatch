"""Guards the enqueue-time hole that let two UNWINNABLE jobs launch (2026-09-19).

`ollama-queue.py:_preflight_verify()` refused an unrunnable verify only on exit
126/127. A verify whose SCRIPT is missing does not exit 126/127 -- `python3
missing.py` exits 2 -- so it sailed through and was stamped
"preflight-verify-ok (baseline fails as designed)". The worker then tells the model
those pre-existing failures ARE the bug it was asked to fix, and answers every
task_complete with "NOT ACCEPTED: the verification command still fails" however good
the work is. The model burns its whole budget and the round is recorded as
DID-NOT-CONVERGE -- misread as model incapacity.

Live evidence: jobs 0f3f0e7af69a (auto-refine-esim-global-s1-parse-global-r1) and
acf67b79baf1 (auto-refine-bg-captcha-s3-vision-r1), both `verify =
"python3 auto-harness-check.py"` with that script absent from their cwd, both carrying
the `preflight-verify-ok` stamp. The second had already produced a genuine VERIFY_OK
in its own tree.

The guard must be NARROW: it may only refuse when the missing file is the verify's OWN
script. A CREATION task's fixture imports a target that does not exist yet, so
"No such file" / "Cannot find module" at baseline is BY DESIGN there and refusing it
would break every creation dispatch.
